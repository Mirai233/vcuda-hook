## Why This Project?
Based on several core motivations, I developed this project:

- Personal Technical Interest and Professional Needs: Driven by interest in GPU virtualization technology and CUDA programming, along with related requirements encountered in practical work
- Open Architecture: Provide an open-source solution that allows the community to participate in improvements and feature extensions
- High Scalability: Design a flexible architecture that supports various GPU virtualization scenarios, including GPU resource sharing in containerized environments
- Dynamic Controllability: Implement runtime dynamic configuration and management capabilities, allowing GPU resource allocation adjustments based on demand
- Transparent Proxy Layer: Serve as a transparent proxy for CUDA dynamic libraries, enabling GPU virtualization functionality without modifying existing applications

This project aims to provide a simple and easy-to-use GPU virtualization solution for containerized environments, enabling safe and efficient sharing of GPU resources among multiple containers.
