# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain the latest development branch and the most recent tagged release. Older tags and forks are provided as-is without security backports.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- **Private reports only.** Please do not open public issues for security problems.
- Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/about-github-security-advisories) to submit a private report to the maintainers.
- Include as much detail as possible (reproduction steps, affected versions, proposed impact) so we can triage quickly.
- We aim to acknowledge new reports within 3 business days and keep you updated on remediation progress until resolution.

## Disclosure Guidelines

- We request a 90-day embargo period before public disclosure unless we agree on a different timeline.
- Once a fix is available, we will publish a summary in the release notes and credit reporters who consent to attribution.
